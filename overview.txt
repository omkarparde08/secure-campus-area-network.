Secure Campus Area Network Systems Project

Title: Secure Campus Area Network Systems
Objective: To design and implement a secure, scalable, and efficient
campus area network (CAN) that connects multiple departments,
branches, and servers while maintaining high performance and data
security.

Description: This project focuses on building a campus-wide network
infrastructure integrating various departments such as Computer
Science, Business Management, Engineering, and Healthcare. The
network includes multiple VLANs, routers, switches, servers (FTP,
Email, DHCP, Web), and wireless access points to provide
connectivity for PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The system
ensures secure communication through router configurations,
subnetting, and access control mechanisms.

Key Features: Segregated VLANs for each department Centralized
DHCP and DNS services Secure routing between branches using
static and dynamic routes Integrated Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
Server Room with Email, Web, and FTP services Branch connectivity
with static IP and serial communication Enhanced network
monitoring and scalability


Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer, Networking Devices (Router,
Switch, Access Point), WLC, Server, PC, and Laptop.
Outcome: A fully functional, secure, and efficient campus network
that supports departmental communication, resource sharing, and
scalability for future expansions
