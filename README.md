# Secure Campus Area Network System

The Secure Campus Area Network System is a Cisco Packet Tracer-based project 
that connects multiple departments in a campus using VLANs, routers, core switches, 
and firewall configurations. The goal is to build a secure, efficient, and scalable 
network for communication and data sharing between different departments.

- To design a secure and structured network for a campus environment.
- To implement VLANs for logical segmentation of departments.
- To configure static routing and inter-VLAN communication.
- To provide firewall protection for network security.
- To ensure efficient connectivity between all departments and servers.
